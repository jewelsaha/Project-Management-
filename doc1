* Full team will be involve during WBS Preparation 
* The procedure in which we break down the project in a smaller manageable component is called Decomposition. 
* 100% Rule means when we break down a component and prepare sub component. All sub component will prepare 100% of Parent component. There will be no Gap
* Lowest level of WBS : Those who does not have sub component anymore, calls Work Package (WP)    


1. Scope Management : First understanding, what is the objective of this project, Whats our target (WHY), 
What should we do there (WHAT) ? Which outputs / Deliverables will help us to reach on our goal ?  

2. Next Target is to work with the above scope, to deliver the product on a right time, 
   - What Activities shall we need to complete and
   - Which Sequences should we complete ? 
In that scope, then we'll identify which part will take what times. 
If any changes happen, we'll need to update the schedule also. 


3. Now, will have to check what kind of 
Quality Criteria, Expectations, Compliance, Standard should be applied to get Quality Product, Output, Deliverables to satisfy the customer 

4. Now we know, Scope, we know Quality Expectation, we know Schedule. 
So now we need to determine 1. Types of Resources and 2. Quantity of Resources (People, Material, Equipment, Facilities, Money).

5. Now If we aggregate all the portion cost, we shall have Project Budget.
